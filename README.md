# Intro to Charles Web Proxy for Desktops and Smartphones

Some test cycles require extended logging of the internet traffic from/to your device or a connection routed through a proxy server. For that purpose, you'll have to deal with the proxy server software, such as Charles Web Proxy.

Let's go throgh the installatio and configuration steps:

✰ Download and install Charles

✰ Connect a Smartphone or Tablet to Charles

✰ Capture SSL traffic using Charles

✰ Export device logs for attaching them to bug reports

## Download and Install

Although Charles is not an open source software or a free tool, a demo version is available. It can be downloaded and used for free, but limits each session to 30 minutes. Consequently, you have to restart the software now and then, if you want to use it for a more extended period. 

Download the appropriate version of [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/) for your OS.
