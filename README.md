# Intro to Charles Web Proxy for Desktops and Smartphones

Some test cycles require extended logging of the internet traffic from/to your device or a connection routed through a proxy server. For that purpose, I have to deal with some proxy server software, such as Charles Web Proxy.

Let's go throgh the installatio and configuration steps:

🔵 [Download and install Charles](https://github.com/lana-20/charles-setup/blob/main/README.md#download-and-install)

🔵 [Connect a Smartphone or Tablet to Charles](https://github.com/lana-20/charles-setup/blob/main/README.md#connect-devices)

🔵 [Capture SSL traffic using Charles]()

🔵 [Export device logs for attaching them to bug reports]()

## Download and Install

Although Charles is not an open source software or a free tool, a demo version is available. It can be downloaded and used for free, but limits each session to 30 minutes. Consequently, I have to restart the software now and then, if I want to use it for a more extended period.

Download the OS-appropriate version of [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/).

Once the installation is finished, start the software. I have to wait 10 seconds at every start.

## Connect Devices

As Charles is running now, I want to route all the network traffic from and to my devices through it. Depending on the device I plan to use, perform the following steps matching the device(s).

### Desktops

I am already done! As soon as Charles is running, it automatically captures and records all browser traffic. This procedure typically covers the most common browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. I can quickly check the proxy connection by following these steps:

♦ Ensure that **Windows** or **macOS** Proxy is enabled in the Proxy menu.

♦ Click the 🧹 broom button (leftmost) in the Charles toolbar to clean the logs.

♦ Open the browser and navigate to a random site.

♦ Observe new log entries popping up in the Charles log.

♦ I can also pause and resume the logging at any time using the second red/grey button in the toolbar.

If I can see my log filling up, I'm good to go.

### Mobile Devices

#### Gather ② crucial pieces of information first.

Before I can configure my mobile device to use Charles, I need to know the IP address of my computer (running Charles) and the port. This can quickly be done as follows:

♦ Click **Help > Local IP Address** to locate the IP. The address consists of four blocks of one to three digits each. It most certainly starts with <code>192</code> and must not end with <code>1</code>. In my case it's <code>192.168.178.100</code>

♦ I also need to know the port, that Charles is using.

  I need both numbers for the next step.

‼️ Important note when connecting *new* mobile devices:
  Once a new device tries to connect to my Charles session, Charles will ask me to **grant the permission** to do so. I make sure to allow my connection. I also **disable or appropriately configure any firewall or internet security** and permit incoming traffic to Charles respectively to port 8888 or the port I've determined for Charles before.

#### Connect Android Smartphone

To connect an Android smartphone, head to the WiFi settings and proceed as follows:

♦ Go to **Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi**

♦ Locate the active connection, long-tap it and select **Modify network**

♦ Expand the *Advanced options*, tap at **None** below *Proxy* and select **Manual**

♦ Enter the IP address from the previous step into the *Proxy hostname* field and the port into the *Proxy port* field

♦ Tap Save. <img width=40 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/223303936-93820a76-13af-4d15-bd77-072e21d34273.png">
